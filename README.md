# Technical Guide

## How to run the sample App
### Run the script below to install dependencies and start the app on development mode
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### NB: The focus of this small exercise was accessibility

## Other improvements to be considered
- Move the ordered list to a separate page.
- Add button to update the ordered list or remove from the list
- Add unit tests
- Adding pagination should be considered for a real-world app since the list will likely grow, but in this case it's too small to do so.
